 Bug 1067721 - [e10s] "Save Snapshot As" dialog box doesn't open
</a>
<div>
 Here's the code in question:
 <a href="http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/366d06412304/browser/base/content/nsContextMenu.js#l1039">

</div>
<div>
 So this doesn't work because "this.target", in this function, is a CPOW, and we can't seem to call ctxDraw.drawImage with a CPOW.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 The simplest solution, I think, to send a message down to the content process, and have it send back the data URI to be saved - thereby making this a bit more asynchronous.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 I think that should be straight-forward. Let me give that a shot.

 Yeah! It works. Ok, so how about a test?
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 I can stash saveImageURL, overwrite it, and return it on test shutdown, which would allow me to capture the DataURI.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 So, the test should: Play a &lt;video&gt; video, call saveVideoFrameAsImage, and then we should make sure that our saveImageURL is eventually called with a dataURL as the first argument. Worth it?
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Totally worth it. And I don't even need to overwrite saveImageURL - there's this MockTransfer thing that browser_save_video.js uses that I can re-use.
</div>

 Yikes! In browser/base/content/test/general/head.js, promisePopupEvent had this:
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 if (popup.state = endState)
</div>
<div>
 return Promise.resolve();
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 That's bad bad bad! That'll always evaluate to true. Luckily, it looks like nobody was using this function (until me, that is).

 Huh… failing bc1 test. My test. It's failing out there. Grrrr...

 Ok, I've found a way to simulate right click with a frame script that seems to work. Re-pushing:

 Tried felipe's document.popupNode idea, but it looks like it's not defined. My regression test fails in the e10s case. Didn't try in the non-e10s case. Not too surprising though - looks like popupNode is on the outs:

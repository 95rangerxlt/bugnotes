 Bug 1126311 - Disable OMTC warning for new e10s windows on Linux if browser.remote.tabs.autostart.1 is true
</a>
<div>
 Wait - is this a bug or not? I just tested this, and I can't seem to get the alert to display even if I have e10s disabled. The hell?
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 The reason I filed this bug was because of the test I wrote for bug 1047603. Let me build that and try to get the alert to display.

 "To use out-of-process tabs, you must set the layers.offmainthreadcomposition.enabled preference and restart. Opening a normal window instead."

 Ah, ok - I had OMTC force-enabled on my e10s profile.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 So I actually don't think this is a bug. I'll explain in my livecoding session.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 What I really want to do is have those tests disabled due to bug 994541.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 So I just need to update my patch in bug 1047603 with a new comment.

<div>
 WAAAAAAAIT. There is a bug here. I WAS WRONG.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 EVEN WITH e10s enabled by default, we still display that warning dialog when I try to open a window.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 STR:
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 1) On a Linux machine with e10s enabled by default, open up the browser console (Ctrl-Shift-J)
</div>
<div>
 2) Enter this into the console: OpenBrowserWindow({remote: true}); and press Enter
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 ER:
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 This should open up an e10s window without any difficulty, since we're already running with an e10s window.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 AR:
</div>
<div>

</div>
<div>
 We get a warning about OMTC being disabled, which is FALSE because OMTC has been force enabled by way of e10s being enabled by default.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Review request up!

 Why is privateWindow commented out in the test for bug 1047603? Huh, no need. Looks like leftover cruft. I've updated the patch.

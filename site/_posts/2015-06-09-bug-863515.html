 Bug 863515 - Electrolysis: Make content.opener work
</a>
<div>
 content.opener… what the hell is this and why do we use it?
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Oh, I guess we want to know if the browser was opened by way of some other browser.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 I don't think I want to expose the opener to the parent process. Instead, I could expose a boolean on the &lt;xul:browser&gt; on whether or not it has an opener.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 I think we're just doing presence checks anyway.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Ok, so I couldn't send up the opener info on Browser:Init because it's not set yet - it's done in nsWindowWatcher::ReadyOpenedDocShellItem, which happens after browser-child.js executes, it seems.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 So I have to set a load listener and send up information then. I'll only do the first load.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Patch posted, try push out.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Hrm. So with my current patch, there's this little window of time where hasContentOpener might not be true. I think I need to make sure we never hit that window...
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Boo. :(
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 So I've added a throw when in the indeterminate state, and I'll do a try build to see if we hit it.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Garrr… this isn't going to work. I'm getting the throw. :(
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 I've asked smaug whether or not we can somehow move assigning the opener earlier, so that we can access it at the Browser:init point in browser-child.js.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 smaug says yes it can be done, but it needs to be done before we add &lt;xul:browser&gt; to the document, it think.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 So my new plan is to expose a bool on nsITabParent that says whether a TabParent had a content opener, and set that to true in TabParent when responding to the create window message.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 smaug likes it! Just need to remember to bump the uuid of the IDL next time.

 Bug 1094170 - (e10s) Error 400 on "Why was this page blocked"

 I actually thing this is totally related to
 <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1094172">
  bug 1094172

 .

 We load the about:neterror pages in the parent process it seems. And if the alleged attack page is in the content process that means we redirect to the parent, which…ahhhhhhh...

 so about:blocked is special, because it's one of those internal docshell pages that don't update the browser urlbar and stuff. We're losing those powers when we redirect to the parent.

 I don't think there's anything that prevents the about:blocked page from running in the content process. That seems to fix both this and bug 1094172.

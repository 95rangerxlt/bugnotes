 Bug 1102410 - AboutProtocolChild attempts to register the same factory twice for multiple nsIAboutModule's
</a>
<div>
 Ok, starting to look into this now.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 I was able to reproduce this on the weekend. Let me just confirm again.
</div>
<div>

  the latest commit is "Added pga matcher" that was included on amo
 </div>
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Ok, that's useful. That revision that emtwo linked me to is the revision that's on AMO, which is breaking BugzillaJS.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 I can reproduce this without difficulty using that particular revision, and the AMO version of BugzillaJS.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Both BugzillaJS and ID are restartless, and I have BugzillaJS installed and working, and then install ID, BugzillaJS continues to work until restart.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Which makes me think that somehow ID is interfering with BugzillaJS's start-up.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Also, I just want to see if this is reproducible using the tip of the ID repository. If not, then I can bisect, which will really narrow things down.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 HA! LUCKY! Looks like BugzillaJS works with the tip of the ID repository. Bisecting time!
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Huh… getting this from git bisect:
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Some good revs are not ancestor of the bad rev.
 <div>
  git bisect cannot work properly in this case.
 </div>
 <div>
  Maybe you mistake good and bad revs?
 </div>
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 I guess bisect is not used to the idea that something _used_ to be broken, and now something is fixed. Huh. So now I have to swap my notion of good/bad works/broken to use git bisect. Lovely.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Ok, bisect done. Apparently
 <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/interest-dashboard/tree/873566fcf6d5660eed7867a127497783ea4a9d2e">
  873566fcf6d5660eed7867a127497783ea4a9d2e
 </a>
 is what fixed things:
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 So one of these changes fixed things on tip. I'd like to figure out which one. I'm going to revert them one by one until I go from
 <b>
  working to busted.
 </b>
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 And then I'll know which file change resulted in Interest Dashboard being fixed. And then I'll probably bisect the changes in the file itself until I find the change that fixed the problem.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Why all of this effort? I want to make sure that whatever problem Interest Dashboard used to have is not something that could easily happen with other add-ons, and make sure there's nothing in there that our shims could have fixed.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Hm, I was just going to do this in order, but I think it's far more likely that something from lib/ fixed things. Let's go by most to least likely.

 </div>
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Ah… some change in Application.js broke things… let me try to confirm… what were these changes?
</div>
<div>
 <div>
  <br/>
 </div>
 <div>
  I guess I'll need to revert the changes one by one until I find the thing that caused the problem...
 </div>
 <div>
  <br/>
 </div>
 <div>
  Oh, not revert now - since I've already reverted Application.js for this test, I'll
  <b>
   reapply
  </b>
  the changes, to see when I go from broken to fixed.
 </div>
 <div>
  <br/>
 </div>
 <div>
  Ah, so apparently what fixed things was when in Application.js, we removed DevMenu, which is an about: module.
 </div>
 <div>
  <br/>
 </div>
 <div>
  Hypothesis - our add-on shims break horribly if an SDK add-on (or any add-on, really) attempts to register more than 1 about: module.
 </div>
 <div>
  <br/>
 </div>
</div>
<div>
 So what's a cheap way to test this?...
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Probably the cheapest way is to create a test-case add-on that creates two nsIAboutModule components and registers them.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 This is looking very plausible - I've isolated the changes down to the registration of the DevMenu nsIAboutModule factory.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Now looking increeeeedbly plausible. I deregistered the second nsIAboutModule, and things worked again - so it has nothing specifically to do with the DevMenu nsIAboutModule per se, but almost certainly because the fact that there's two of them.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 So I think this is definitely our shims bugging out. Let me write this in the bug.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 I might be able to create a test case using the pre-existing shims tests.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 (If my minimal testcase doesn't work - I should check to make sure that the problem isn't in how the SDK registers factories… though that seems pretty unlikely as the cause.)
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 NS_ERROR_FACTORY_EXISTS: Component returned failure code: 0xc1f30100 (NS_ERROR_FACTORY_EXISTS) [nsIComponentRegistrar.registerFactory]
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 This is likely the issue. Why would this break pagemod though?
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Ohhh… because that operates during initialization...
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Wait… is that the problem? Wouldn't this happen even without the ID add-on?
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Hm, no it doesn't. Ok.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Time to write a test case. Let's register two about: pages and make sure they work.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 My test case isn't doing the right thing - anyhow, I think I've solved the mystery here - the AboutProtocolChild will attempt to register itself twice when it tracks an nsIAboutModule getting registered in the parent.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 So here's what happens.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 The first browser-child.js starts up… and it calls RemoteAddonsChild.init on itself.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 RemoteAddonsChild, starts itself up the first time, and calls makeReady on itself.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 NotificationTracker.init is called, which populates the NotificationTracker with all of the information about shims it should hook up.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 ContentPolicyChild.init is called. That goes just fine.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 AboutProtocolChild.init is called - here's where things go wrong - for each tracking for the AboutProtocol, we attempt to register the same AboutProtocolChild as the factory. Repeated calls result in an exception being thrown.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 So we throw an exception, and so makeReady fails out. That's why subsequent creations of browser-child.js's result in makeReady getting called again - because makeReady didn't succeed, RemoteAddonsChild just assumed that it had never started up before, and calls makeReady again for that new browser-child.js.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Let me write this up in the bug.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Changing bug summary from
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Interest Dashboard breaks BugzillaJS
</div>
<div>
 to
</div>
<div>
 AboutProtocolChild attempts to register the same factory twice for multiple nsIAboutModule's
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 since it's more descriptive.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 So my test does a good job of getting us into the error state - but it's not so good at detecting when the error is occurring. This is because attempts at loading my about: pages results in them being loaded in the parent process, since they're blacklisted.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 What's a good way of testing that this registration of the about: pages has gone all wrong?
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Oh - I can take advantage that we prefix test some about: urls in E10SUtils shouldBrowserBeRemote to determine if… well, a browser should be remote. about:neterror is one of the things that passes the prefix sniff test - so perhaps I should name my test pages about:neterror-test1 and about:neterror-test2. It's hacky, but it's also a test and the best I can come up with, and I'd rather have a hacky test then no test at all.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Let's give that a shot.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Yes, this works. Before I continue though, I had a new idea - perhaps add-on code can XHR to those about pages. That'd be a little less hacky, probably… and it'd bypass the blacklisting that E10SUtils uses. A little more verbose though.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Let's try that.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Ooooh - yes, this will work nicely.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Ok, test written. Fix written. Cleaning up now, and attaching.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Posted.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 The one thing I'm not sure about is this loadGroup change I had to make. In AboutProtocolChannel in RemoteAddonsChild.jsm, I ran into a problem where I'd get a "this.loadGroup is null" error when running the test. From my understanding, loadGroup is something that starts out as null, and that the caller needs to set (ugh)… so have I uncovered a networking bug here? I've changed the code to handle the null case, but I'm not sure if that's the right call. I've asked billm for more information.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Hey, ok - billm likes the fix. I'm redirected the review request for the test patch to ally, since she wants to get her hands more dirty, review-wise.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 For the test, ally likes it, mrbkap likes it, billm has the following suggestion:
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 15:59 billm: mconley: I think this code should just set loadGroup to null when the child had no load group:
 <a href="http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/addoncompat/RemoteAddonsParent.jsm#244">
  http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/addoncompat/RemoteAddonsParent.jsm#244
 </a>
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 So I can do that, no problem, and then I'll land. Woo!
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Hrm… actually, I'm not sure if billm meant I should replace what I'd done with loadGroup with his suggestion. A flat out replacement results in a throw, because I'm still attempting to access this.loadGroup.notificationCallbacks in the RemoteAddonsChild.jsm when this.loadGroup is null. Perhaps billm meant this as "in addition to"? I've needinfo'd him.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Ah yep, he meant "as well as" - we're good to go to land the test.
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 Aaaaaaaand the trees are closed because AWS. Guess I'll just wait until they're re-opened.
</div>

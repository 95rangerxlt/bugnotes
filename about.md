I've been writing notes while working on various Mozilla bugs, and I thought it might be interesting to publish the raw, unedited notes once I've finished a bug.

These are my unfiltered thoughts as I work on a bug. Some of them will be long, contain stacktraces and snippets of code and IRC conversations. Some will be short and quick.

I don't know if this will ever be useful, but I thought I'd put this stuff out there in case anybody was curious.

I create my notes with [Evernote](http://evernote.com/), export to HTML, and build the site using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).

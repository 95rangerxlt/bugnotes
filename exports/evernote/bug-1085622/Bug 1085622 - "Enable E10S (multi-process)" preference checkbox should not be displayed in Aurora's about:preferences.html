<div>E10S_TESTING_ONLY is dependant on NIGHTLY_BUILD. So is this a bug in NIGHTLY_BUILD as well?</div>

<div>dnl ========================================================
<div>dnl Multiprocess Firefox Nightly Testing UI</div>
<div>dnl To be removed in Bug 1003313</div>
<div>dnl ========================================================</div>
<div>if test -z "$NIGHTLY_BUILD"; then</div>
<div>    E10S_TESTING_ONLY=1</div>
</div>
<div>fi</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>That roughly translates to:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>If NIGHTLY_BUILD is not set, then set E10S_TESTING_ONLY=1.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>That's wrong. That's the opposite of what we want. That should probably be:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>if test -n "$NIGHTLY_BUILD"; then</div>
<div>    E10S_TESTING_ONLY=1</div>
<div>fi</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>-n string     True if the length of string is nonzero.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>If this solves it…then the real mystery is: how come this hasn't been a problem on Beta or Release?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Dunno, but it looks like this is all a ham-show. It looks like regardless of what value E10S_TESTING_ONLY had, we were always defining it. In our moz.build files, we had code like this:
<div><br/></div>
<div>DEFINES['E10S_TESTING_ONLY'] = CONFIG['E10S_TESTING_ONLY']</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Even if E10S_TESTING_ONLY was set to ' ', which seems to be the case if NIGHTLY_BUILD is not set, then we'd still define E10S_TESTING_ONLY.</div>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Meaning that E10S_TESTING_ONLY was <b>always</b> defined.</div>
<div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I've switched it so that the E10S_TESTING_ONLY define is only ever set in a moz.build if CONFIG['E10S_TESTING_ONLY'] is truthy - otherwise, it remains undefined.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I also fixed a case in tabbrowser.xml where we had no #endif for an #ifdef E10S_TESTING_ONLY, which resulted in a busted browser when I first fixed this.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Kinda bad news all around. Luckily, the tabbrowser.xml stuff hasn't reached beta yet - it's only on Aurora and Central.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>It's pretty mysterious why the e10s stuff isn't visible in beta or release. I honestly have no idea. Perhaps the build rules are drastically different - I'm really not sure.</div>
<div><br/></div>
</div>
<div>Anyhow, my patch applied on central still shows the e10s testing UI. Applied to Aurora (after manually applying) gets rid of the e10s testing UI.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Attaching - let's see what people think.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Ah - gavin's got a good idea. Instead of defining E10S_TESTING_ONLY everywhere in every moz.build, let's just globally define it. It's temporary anyway.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Ok, got a patch and a review, and it landed on fx-team, but I forgot to ifdef a gRemoteTabsUI.init() call - strange that there are two of those. Going to land a follow-up.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>And landed on mozilla-aurora. That's good - that thing in tabbrowser.xml was a ticking timebomb.</div>

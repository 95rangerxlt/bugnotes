<div>content.opener… what the hell is this and why do we use it?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Oh, I guess we want to know if the browser was opened by way of some other browser.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I don't think I want to expose the opener to the parent process. Instead, I could expose a boolean on the &lt;xul:browser> on whether or not it has an opener.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I think we're just doing presence checks anyway.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Ok, so I couldn't send up the opener info on Browser:Init because it's not set yet - it's done in nsWindowWatcher::ReadyOpenedDocShellItem, which happens after browser-child.js executes, it seems.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>So I have to set a load listener and send up information then. I'll only do the first load.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Patch posted, try push out.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Hrm. So with my current patch, there's this little window of time where hasContentOpener might not be true. I think I need to make sure we never hit that window...</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Boo. :(</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>So I've added a throw when in the indeterminate state, and I'll do a try build to see if we hit it.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Garrr… this isn't going to work. I'm getting the throw. :(</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I've asked smaug whether or not we can somehow move assigning the opener earlier, so that we can access it at the Browser:init point in browser-child.js.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>smaug says yes it can be done, but it needs to be done before we add &lt;xul:browser> to the document, it think.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>So my new plan is to expose a bool on nsITabParent that says whether a TabParent had a content opener, and set that to true in TabParent when responding to the create window message.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>smaug likes it! Just need to remember to bump the uuid of the IDL next time.</div>
<div><br/></div>
